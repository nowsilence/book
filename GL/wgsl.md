Following syntax notation describes the conventions of the syntactic grammar of WGSL:

Italic text on both sides of a rule indicates a syntax rule.

Bold monospace text starting and ending with single quotes (') on the right-hand side of a rule indicates keywords and tokens.

A colon (:) in regular text registers a syntax rule.

A vertical bar (|) in regular text indicates alternatives.

An question mark (?) in regular text indicates that previous keyword, token, rule, or group occurs zero or one times (is optional).

An asterisk (*) in regular text indicates that previous keyword, token, rule, or group occurs zero or more times.

A plus (+) in regular text indicates that previous keyword, token, rule, or group occurs one or more times.

A matching pair of opening parenthesis (() and closing parenthesis ()) in regular text indicates a group of elements.
